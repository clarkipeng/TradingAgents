# ADR 0001: Modular monolith delivered through vertical strangler slices

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-08-05

## Context

The repository has working collector, offline research, portfolio, deployment, and test behavior,
but several upstream modules still mix orchestration, persistence, configuration, scheduling, and
domain logic. The former permanent paper workers were removed on 2026-08-06; the strangler
principle now applies to the collector and explicit offline artifact phases.

The current setuptools configuration installs `tradingagents*` and `cli*`; independent top-level
application packages would not be included automatically.

## Decision

Keep one installable modular monolith. New code follows the inward dependency direction:

```text
domain <- ports <- application <- adapters/apps
```

Deliver it through one exercised vertical seam at a time. Every new boundary requires:

- a current caller or compatibility adapter;
- characterization and parity tests;
- an import-boundary test;
- no default runtime behavior change until parity is demonstrated; and
- an explicit removal condition for the legacy path.

Composition roots will initially live under `tradingagents/apps/`. We will not create empty
directories or interfaces merely to match the target diagram.

## Consequences

- Existing upstream CLIs, the collector Fly entrypoint, applied schemas, and the frozen V2 protocol
  remain stable during early extraction.
- Some legacy imports and global configuration remain temporarily.
- Architecture coverage grows as a ratchet instead of applying unachievable rules to all legacy
  modules immediately.
- Separate packages, services, and an external event bus require measured need and a later ADR.

## Rejected alternatives

- Big-bang rewrite: too much semantic and deployment risk.
- Immediate microservices: adds coordination and operations without current scale evidence.
- Full empty package skeleton: creates abstractions without proving useful contracts.
